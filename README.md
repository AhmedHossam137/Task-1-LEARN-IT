Project: C# Challenges - If Statements & Switch Case
This project contains solutions to three programming challenges focused on mastering if-statements and switch-case statements in C#. Each challenge addresses a different problem and applies conditional logic, user input handling, and basic error checking.

Challenge 1: User Login System
Description:
A simple user registration and login system. The user first registers by providing a username and password, and then logs in using the same credentials. The system verifies if the provided login details match the ones used during registration. This program executes in a single run since persistent data storage hasn't been covered yet.
Uses if-statements to check if the credentials match.
Implements user input handling with basic validation.


Challenge 2: Highscore Tracker
Description:
An application that tracks a game’s high score and its holder. It includes a method that accepts the player’s score and name, comparing the score against the current high score. If the score is higher, the high score and the high score player are updated.
Uses if-statements to compare scores and update the high score if needed.
Displays appropriate messages for whether a new high score is set or not.


Challenge 3: Basic Calculator
Description:
A simple calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and selects the desired operation. The program checks for invalid operations and handles division by zero gracefully.
Implemented using a switch statement for operation selection.
Error handling for invalid operator inputs and division by zero.
